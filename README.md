# A Beginners Guide to Computer Vulnerabilities

The primary purpose of this repo is to help new software developers who haven't been exposed to writing programs with a focus on informatio security. In school, we are given assignments that focus on functionality and thus most programmers overlook many vulnerabilities that can compromise sensitive information handled by their program.


## What is a Computer Vulnerability?

There are numerous definitions by countless security organizations. I came up with a hybrid of all of them that I think best defines what a computer vulnerability is:
>A **state of being exposed** to a possible attack, thus **reducing the information assurance** of the system.

## Classification of Computer Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability can arise in many different areas of a system. We will categorize our vulnerabilities using the BS ISO/IEC 27005:2008. This standard categorizes vulnerabilities in general for an information technology organization but it encompasses all computer vulnerabilities.

The following is the categorization of vulnerabilities in an IT organization and the bold categories deal mainly with computer vulnerabilities:
 1. **Hardware**
 2. **Software**
 3. **Network**
 4. Personnel
 5. Physical Site
 6. Organizational

We can see from above that these vulnerabilities arise in all three aspects of the PPT (People, Process, Technology) of an organization. Even though we will focus only on the process and technology aspects of these vulnerabilities, it is paramount for an organization to focus on all three to maximize the organization's information assurance.
